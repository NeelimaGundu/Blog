After drought struck, and their agriculture slowed down, they started stitching to sustain their families. The quality of their bags is admired by all, and they have supplied to many conferences, events and functions. They also make tasty pickles, free of preservatives, using traditional recipies. They make different designed bags, vegetable storing bags to keep in fridge. The bags are made from absolutely eco-friendly 'jute'.
